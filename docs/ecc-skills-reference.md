| `clickhouse-io`                | ClickHouse analytics database patterns               | Niche but usable from PHP. Low priority — few PHP projects use ClickHouse directly.                                        | ➖      |
| `postgres-patterns`            | PostgreSQL query optimization, schema, indexing      | Partially covered by `skills/doctrine-orm-patterns/performance.md` + `agents/php-database-reviewer.md`.                    | ✅      |
